## Database Schema

### User Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE User (
    UserID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

### Email Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Email (
    EmailID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Body TEXT NOT NULL,
    Timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### EmailUser Junction Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE EmailUser (
    EmailID INT,
    UserID INT,
    Role ENUM('Sender', 'Receiver') NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmailID, UserID, Role),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmailID) REFERENCES Email(EmailID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES User(UserID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Application Workflow

### 1. User Sign Up / Login
- **Java (OOP)**: User enters details → `User` object created
- **Database (DBMS)**:
    - Signup → Insert into `User` table
    - Login → Validate with `SELECT * FROM User WHERE Name=? AND Password=?`

### 2. Composing & Sending Email
- **Java (OOP)**: User types subject, body, receiver → `Email` object created
- **Database (DBMS)**:
    - Insert into `Email` table (subject, body, timestamp)
    - Insert into `EmailUser` table with sender and receiver relationships

### 3. Viewing Inbox
- **Java (OOP)**: User opens Inbox
- **Database (DBMS)**: Query `EmailUser` where `Role='Receiver'` and join with `Email` table

### 4. Viewing Sent Items
- **Java (OOP)**: User opens Sent folder
- **Database (DBMS)**: Query `EmailUser` where `Role='Sender'` and join with `Email` table

### 5. Logging Out
- **Java (OOP)**: End user session and clear current objects
- **Database (DBMS)**: No changes needed (data persisted)

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL Server 8.0 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended IDE)
- MySQL Connector/J JAR file

### IntelliJ IDEA Setup

1. **Create New Project:**
    - Open IntelliJ IDEA → New Project → Java
    - Name: `EmailClientProject`

2. **Add MySQL Connector:**
    - Create `lib/` folder in project root
    - Copy `mysql-connector-j-8.x.x.jar` to `lib/` folder
    - Right-click JAR → Add as Library

3. **Configure Database Connection:**
    - Update `DatabaseHelper.java` with your MySQL credentials:
   ```java
   private static final String DB_USER = "your_username";
   private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "your_password";
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**
    - Right-click `Main.java` → Run 'Main.main()'

### MySQL Database Setup

1. **Start MySQL Server**
2. **Create Database (Optional):**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE email_client;
   ```
3. **The application will automatically create tables on first run**

### Loading Sample Data

To load sample data for testing:
```bash
mysql -u root -p email_client < database/sample_data.sql
```

## Features

5. **Constraints**: Primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints

## Usage Examples

### Sample User Accounts (from sample_data.sql)
- Username: `Vandan_Sharma`, Password: `vandan2006`
- Username: `Shashwat_Upadhyay`, Password: `shashwat2025`
- Username: `Aksh_Upase`, Password: `aksh123`

### Testing Workflow
1. Login with existing account or create new account
2. Send an email to another user
3. Check inbox for received emails
4. View sent items to confirm email delivery
5. Logout and login as different user to test full workflow

## Running the Application

### In IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Ensure MySQL connector JAR is added to libraries
3. Update database credentials in `DatabaseHelper.java`
4. Run `Main.java`

### Command Line (Alternative)
```bash
# Compile
javac -cp "lib/*" src/*.java -d out/

# Run
java -cp "lib/*:out" Main
```

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Database connection failures with detailed messages
